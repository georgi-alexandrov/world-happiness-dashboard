The goal of this dashboard is to provide insights into the World Happiness dataset, enabling users to:
- Visualize happiness scores across countries, regions, and time.
- Filter and explore data by year, region, and country.
- Analyze correlations between happiness score components.
- Gain insights into contributing factors to happiness.

## üåü Highlights

### üåê Top 10 - The Countries with Highest and Lowest Happiness Scores

The **Top 10 Page** provides insights into the happiest and least happy countries based on the World Happiness dataset. Users can:

- View the top 10 happiest countries and the bottom 10 least happy countries based on average happiness scores from 2015 to 2019.
- Explore the top 10 happiest and least happy countries for a specific year.
- Visualize the data using interactive bar charts, making it easy to compare happiness scores across countries.

This page offers a quick overview of global happiness rankings and highlights the countries at both ends of the happiness spectrum.

### ‚ú® Contributing Factors

The **Contributing Factors Page** provides insights into the key factors that influence happiness scores across countries. Users can:

- Explore how factors such as GDP, social support, life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and corruption perception contribute to happiness scores.
- Visualize the relationships between these factors and happiness scores using scatter plots - exloring general, regional or yearly trends.
- Compare the importance of different factors across countries or regions.
- Analyze trends in contributing factors to understand their evolving impact on happiness.

This page helps users dive deeper into the underlying drivers of happiness and uncover meaningful patterns in the data.

  <h3>Example: Generosity Correlation</h3>
  <p>
    This example highlights how the Generosity factor shows an <strong>almost horizontal trend line</strong> when analyzed against the Happiness Score, indicating a <strong>very low correlation</strong>. 
    This suggests that, in general, generosity has minimal influence on happiness levels across countries. While generosity may contribute to individual well-being, its impact on overall happiness scores appears to be less significant compared to other factors like GDP or social support.

  <h3>Example: GDP per Capita Correlation</h3>
  <p>
    This example highlights how GDP per Capita shows a <strong>stronger positive correlation</strong> with the Happiness Score in Western Europe compared to Eastern and Central Europe. 
    This suggests that economic prosperity plays a more significant role in influencing happiness levels in Western Europe, while other factors may have a greater impact in Eastern and Central Europe.

<div style="border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0; border-radius: 5px; text-align: center;">
  <h3>Example: Trust and Happiness</h3>
  <p>
    In this region, there is a <strong>negative correlation</strong> between Trust (government corruption) and the Happiness Score. 
    This means that as the perception of government corruption increases (lower trust), the Happiness Score tends to decrease. 
    Conversely, regions with higher trust in government institutions generally report higher happiness levels. 
    This highlights the significant impact of governance and institutional integrity on overall happiness.
